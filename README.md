learning about columns and rows in bootstrap
to implement a row, name the div class row
<div class="row">

</div>
to implement a column, you just name the class of the div col.

<div class="col" style="background-color:  border: 1px solid;"
this should be included INSIDE the row div in order to choose columns within the row (like in excel).

columns in bootstrap are set up into 12 units.
to get separate column sizes, you can name it based on the unit.
col 12- this would make the section fill up the entire width of the row.
col 6- this would make the section will half of the entire width of the row

ID- you must use # infront of the id specification in order to target the ID in css
ex. id= "title", then on css target by #title
